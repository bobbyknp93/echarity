                    eCharity foundation is an international not-for-profit (or non-profit) organization that was founded to support the victims of domestic violence (with a particular focus on victims of acid splash). Our mission is to reach out to this most vulnerable, often neglected and forgotten members of society and help them out by providing them different types of support. The first and foremost goal is to restore their health and well-being, as much as possible, by providing them with cutting-edge medical treatments. Raising awareness is yet another goal of eCharity. We believe, by educating, not punishing, we can reduce and eventually eliminate the occurrence of this crime and crimes like this. Our ultimate mission is to support the victims to get back on their feet, once again, gain their self-confidence and to live a full life!
